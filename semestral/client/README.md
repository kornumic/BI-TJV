# Work Manager

This is semestral project made by Michal Korn√∫c. 

To run this web application you need to have server running (more info in server project). If the server is running,
you can run this application by running WebApplication class. 

After that you can open `localhost:8081/workmanager` in your browser.

## Using Work Manager

In main menu you can choose `Employees`, `Jobs` and `Place`. After clicking on it list of all Employees (or others)
will be shown. From there you can add new employee or delete one. By clicking on `Info` you will be taken to site of 
clicked employee with all of his info and assigned+assignable jobs. 

You can always go back to main menu by clicking on `Work Manager` on top of the screen
